# ADR-002: Inspection Produces At Most One Issue in V1

## Status

Accepted

## Context

UC-004 Perform Inspection records a binary `issueIdentified` outcome on each Inspection.

UC-005 Record Issue creates an Issue when that flag is true.

The initial UC-005 implementation allowed multiple Issues per Inspection in the backend, while the frontend already treated each Inspection as recordable only once.

UC-006 Make Operational Decision now assumes that one Issue receives at most one Operational Decision in V1.

Business Discovery describes Issue identification as a binary inspection outcome, not as an open-ended collection of separate Issue records per Inspection.

## Decision

For InfraTrack V1, an Inspection may produce zero or one Issue.

The backend rejects a second Issue for the same Inspection with HTTP 409 Conflict.

Multiple defects observed during the same Inspection must be described within the single Issue description field for V1.

## Consequences

**Positive**

- Backend and frontend behaviour are aligned in V1.
- Operational Decision logic can assume at most one Issue per completed Inspection in V1.
- UC-006 is simpler because it evaluates one Issue at a time, with at most one Operational Decision per Issue in V1.
- The model stays simple and matches the binary inspection outcome already implemented.

**Negative / deferred**

- Separate Issue records for multiple distinct defects from one Inspection are not supported in V1.
- A richer multi-issue inspection model may be introduced later if councils require it.
